# <img alt="qbit-guard logo" src="img/qbit-guard-icon.png"> qbit-guard

A lightweight Python guard for qBittorrent that blocks pre-air TV episodes (Sonarr) and unreleased movies (Radarr), deletes ISO/BDMV-only torrents, and auto-blocklists bad releases in Sonarr/Radarr (with dedupe + queue failover). Runs on "torrent added", fetches metadata safely, and logs everything to stdout.

- **Pre-air gate (Radarr)**: Stops new movie torrents, checks release dates with configurable grace periods
- **Extension policy**: Allow/Block by file extension with configurable strategies
- **ISO/BDMV cleaner**: Removes disc-image-only torrents that lack keepable video content
- **Smart blocklisting**: Blocklists in Sonarr/Radarr before deletion using deduped history
